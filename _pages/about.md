Hi, Iâ€™m Zhenye Luo, a recent Master's graduate from the School of Artificial Intelligence at Beijing Normal University, focusing on AIGC (AI-generated content). During my Master's studies, I worked on music-driven dance generation and published a first-author paper at CVPR (top conference in AI&CV). I previously graduated in 2021 with a degree in Automation from the School of Information Science and Technology at Beijing University of Chemical Technology, where I participated in research on microfluidic chips and their applications. These experiences have given me a solid foundation in mathematics, physics, and control theory. I am proficient in several programming languages, including Python, Pytorch, C++ and MATLAB, and experienced in developing deep learning models on Linux systems such as Ubuntu.

Most importantly, these skills have prepared me to pursue further studies in AIGC and control-related fields (such as robotics). I am currently actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities in these areas. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me via email. Thank you!
