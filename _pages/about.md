Hi, Iâ€™m Zhenye Luo, a recent Master's graduate from the School of Artificial Intelligence at Beijing Normal University, with a focus on AIGC (AI-generated content). During my Master's studies, I worked on music-driven dance generation and published a first-author paper at CVPR, a top conference in AI and computer vision. I previously obtained a Bachelor's degree in Automation from the School of Information Science and Technology at Beijing University of Chemical Technology in 2021, where I also participated in research on microfluidic chips and their applications. These experiences have well-prepared me to pursue further studies in AIGC and control-related fields, such as robotics. I am currently actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities in these areas. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me via email. Thank you!
